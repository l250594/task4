                Yesterday, I went to the store and got some much needed spatuals! (what better way to say i love myself than to buy myself a spatula?)

                My favourite cartoon character is cookie, and my favourite dessert is cupcakes. So Cookie Cupcakes are best of both the worlds. Did you know? Cookie character once said, "Sometimes me think what is love, and then me think love is what cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for you." I wonder if the same applies for the cupcakes? (if so, i dont think i can ever love ANYONE!)
